# StateDB

A minimalistic key-value in-memory database for clustered applications.

## So... What is this again?

As the description above says, it's a database for storing shared state of an application. Why "shared"? Well it all comes to this term "clustered applications". 
They're simply multiple copies of one application. I don't want to explain this here so you can just google it. It's nothing complex.

**Work is in progress so, I guess this is all for now**
